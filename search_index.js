This is because we can consider the sequence u_2 u_3 dots u_n where u_i = v_i + (n - i) for all 2 le i le n Then we must have that since v_i ge v_i+1 for 2 le i le n-1, this means that u_i  u_i+1. We also see that since v_2 le m, this means that u_2 le m + n - 2 and since v_n ge 0, this means that u_2 ge 0. Therefore, to count the number of vertices in a Freudenthal Triangulation, we must just select n-1 distinct integers in the range 0 m+n-2 and this will correspond to a unique sequence u_2 u_3 dots u_n and thus it corresponds to a unique vertex v_1 v_2 dots v_n where m = v_1 ge v_2 ge dots ge v_n ge 0 Thus there are binomm+n-1n-1 = frac(m+n-1)m(n-1) vertices in a Freudenthal triangulation of an n-dimensional space with granularity m.","category":"page"},{"location":"concepts/#Freudenthal-Simplex-and-Barycentric-Coordinates","page":"Concepts","title":"Freudenthal Simplex and Barycentric Coordinates","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"concepts/","page":"Concepts","title":"Concepts","text":"If we know, the values of a function f at the integer Freudenthal vertices, we can use triangulation to estimate the value at an arbitrary point x from the n+1 vertices of the simplex enclosing x:","category":"page"},{"location":"concepts/","page":"Concepts","title":"Concepts","text":"f(x) = sum_i = 1^n+1 lambda_i f(v^(i))","category":"page"},{"location":"concepts/","page":"Concepts","title":"Concepts","text":"where the vertices of the simplex containing x are v^(1) dots v^(n+1).
